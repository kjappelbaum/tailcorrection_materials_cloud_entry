The <em>principal components</em> are the first two principial components
from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the pore-property space.
The <em>MDS components</em> are also product of a dimensionality reduction of
the pore-property space---in this case by means of metric multidimensional scaling.
The goal of both dimensionality reductions is to visualize our sampling process in
two dimensions.
