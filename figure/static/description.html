The <em>principal components</em> are the first two principial components
from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the pore-property space.
The <em>MDS components</em> are also product of a dimensionality reduction of
the pore-property space---in this case by means of metric multidimensional scaling.
The goal of both dimensionality reductions is to visualize our sampling process in
two dimensions. Here the loadings of the first principle component is dominated by the pore-accessible
volume fraction, the density, the accessible surface area and the largest sphere diameters whereas the second
principle component is dominated by the pocket surface area and the non accessible surface area.
