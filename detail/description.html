<h1>{Applicability of tail-corrections in the molecular simulations of porous materials</h1>

<p>
Molecular simulations with periodic boundary conditions require to define a certain cutoff distance <MATH>r_c<\MATH>
beyond which pairwise dispersion interactions, like Lennard-Jones interactions, are neglected.
 For the simulation of homogeneous phases it is well-established to use tail-corrections,
 that can remedy this truncation of the potential.
 These corrections are built under the assumption of randomly displaced particles
 (radial distribution function, <MATH>g(r)<\MATH>, equal to one)
 beyond <MATH>r_\text{c}<\MATH>.  Therefore, it is still under debate
 if they can be used in the modelling of heterogeneous systems,
 like when the fluids are adsorbed in microporous materials: in this work,
 we show that tail-corrections are an appropriate choice even
 for these systems, significantly reducing the error of the truncation.
 Finally, we show their contribution, modelling methane adsorption in a diverse set of zeolites,
 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs).
